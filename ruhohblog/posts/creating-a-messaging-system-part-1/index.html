<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In this series of posts, I&#39;m going to share my experience of how I created a private messaging system between two users. The reason I picked this topic is because I noticed that many other developers had
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5102832/rails-private-message-system">faced similar questions</a> and
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18952216/rails-3-set-a-conversation-id-for-private-messaging">problems</a>
while I was browsing the StackOverFlow threads on the same topic. There was not a consensus among the community on how to develop a private messaging system, only that doing it from scratch would be most convenient for (we) the developers without having to implement an entire gem (i.e. mailboxer) for overkill. </p>

<p>I first started with the logic:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.  A user can send many messages and therefore has many messages.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.  A message can have a sender and a recipient and therefore belongs to a sender and a recipient.<br>
So the two models I start out with are these:</p>

<pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :messages, 
       foreign_key: &quot;messenger_id&quot;
    has_many :received_messages, 
       class_name: &quot;Message&quot;,
       foreign_key: &quot;recipient_id&quot;
end    
</code></pre>

<p>And this:</p>

<pre><code>class Message &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    attr_accessible :content, :messenger_id, :recipient_id

    belongs_to :messenger, 
               class_name: &quot;User&quot;,
               foreign_key: &quot;messenger_id&quot;


    belongs_to :recipient, 
                class_name: &quot;User&quot;, 
                foreign_key: &quot;recipient_id&quot;
end
</code></pre>
